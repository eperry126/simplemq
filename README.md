Simple Message Queue

This project was built mostly as a learning exercise, but it may be useful as a development tool. The Simple Message
Queue is exactly what it sounds like, a pretty simplistic message queue built on top of Thrift services.

There is a binding written for Java right now, but I will update the project with bindings for some other languages.
Also, if anyone wishes to add a binding in a new language, go ahead and make a pull request.

I will update the documentation in the project in the form of Javadocs and I'll put some updates on this README
as well.

I will also serve up an installation package of some sort from my website soon so the server can be downloaded and run
easily.
